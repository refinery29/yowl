# Ontology Test Cases #

* [Empty ontology](input/empty.ttl).
* 'sameAs' relationships between classes, properties and/or individuals. 
* OWL class with one or more keys. 
* OWL individuals with simple/compound key values.
* Multiple individuals with the same key value(s).
* Properties with and without domains and ranges.
* Properties with multiple domains and/or ranges.
* Class hierarchies & property hierarchies.
	* How clearly are these displayed? 
		* Especially in diagrams. 
* Display of super/subclasses and super/subproperties in documentation & diagrams. 
* Classes with constraints on their properties - range and cardinality. 
* Hierarchical constraints within class hierarchies, i.e. constraints becoming tighter as classes are derived. 
* Class with huge number of subclasses, property with huge number of sub properties.
* Class with huge number of constraints.
* Property with huge number of domains, property with huge number of ranges.
* Class/property/individual labels and comments.
* Classes with annotations. 
* Use of namespace prefixes in documentation & diagrams. 
* OWL property chains. 
* Hyperlinking of diagrams to class/property/individual definitions.
* Index/search facility for documentation.
